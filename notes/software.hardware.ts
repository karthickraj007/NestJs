    1)Computer Hardware
        1)Computer hardware is the physical components that a computer system requires to function. 
        2)It can be categorized as having either internal or external components.

    2)Internal Components
        Component parts that are found inside the computer's CPU case are
            1)Motherboard
            2)Processor & RAM
            3)Graphics Card (GPU)
            4)Fans
            5)Hard Disk etc.

    3)External Components
        External hardware components are usually input/output devices that are
            1)Keyboard & Mouse
            2)Monitors & Speakers
            3)USB Drives
            4)WebCam

    4)Ports
        Ports allow us to plug in different components to a computer to enhance its capabilities.
            1)The video display ports are DVI, VGA, and so on.
            2)The video and audio ports are HDMI, display port, and so on.

    5)USB Port
        Instead of having ports for different things, we can use USB (Universal Serial Bus) Port. USB is Designed to standardize many peripheral connections

    6)Motherboard
        The motherboard is the computer's central communication's backbone connectivity point through which all components and external components connect.

    7)CPU
        1)The CPU (Central Processing Unit or processor) is responsible for processing all information from programs. 
        2)It processes many instructions from different programs every second.
        3)CPU Instruction Set
            Programs on the computer are broken down into very small and simple instructions.
            For example:
                1)Add two numbers
                2)Load value from Memory Location
                3)Store Value to Memory Location

    8)CPU Cores
        1)A CPU core is a CPU's processor. 
        2)A core can work on one task. Modern-day devices have multiple cores. 
        3)8 core processor means 8 cores and similar to other cores.  
        4)Each core of a CPU can perform operations separately from the others. 
        5)They may work together to perform parallel operations.

    9)Hard Drive
        1)The hard drive is Non-volatile storage which is responsible for storing permanent and temporary data.
        2)SSD (Solid-state drives) is 25 times faster than regular HDDs (Hard-disk drives)

    10)RAM
        1)RAM is also another type of storage. we can store photos, videos, etc. The RAM is measured in GB we might have heard a lot of times that 2GB RAM, 4GB RAM in Phones, Laptops, etc.
        2)RAM is volatile memory means the data remains in RAM if the computer is on, but it's lost when the computer is turned off.
        3)RAM is much faster to read and write than other types of storage.

    11)RAM vs Hard Drive
            RAM	                                    HARD Drive
        RAM is volatile memory	          Hard drive is a nonvolatile memory
        Relatively Expensive	          Relatively Cheaper
        Faster Data Access	              Relatively Slower Data Access

    12)Registers
        1)Registers are another type of storage. 
        2)Many times much faster than regular storage devices and even RAM which is placed very close to the CPU.

    13)32-bit and 64-bit Systems
        1)A 32-bit processor includes a 32-bit register and Can support up to 4 GB RAM
        2)A 64-bit processor includes a 64-bit register

    14)Graphics Card
        1)Graphics Card is a Specialized processor designed to deal with specific types of instructions efficiently. 
        2)It is used for 3D Rendering, Games, Deep Learning

    15)CPU vs GPU
                    CPU	                                                               GPU
        A CPU can perform a variety of different instructions	       GPU can perform a specialized set of instructions.
        Has few cores (around 2 - 8)	                               Has 1000s of Cores. Good at parallelization

    16)BIOS
        Basic Input Output Services (BIOS) initializes the hardware and gets our operating system up and running.

    17)UEFI
        1)UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) is similar to BIOS, which supports the latest hardware
        2)It performs a secure boot
        3)It performs faster boot
